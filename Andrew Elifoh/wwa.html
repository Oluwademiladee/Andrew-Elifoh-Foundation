            Pa Andrew Elifoh whose memorial birth this foundation is a man with
            a big heart whose legacy would always be remembered. <br>
            He sacrifices whatever he has for the growth and development
            of his children and those around him. He was a man who used
            the little he had to educate others in order to give them a 
            better life and he so much wished that he had the financial
            capability to train so many children especially those who 
            were not so opportune.
            His desire to have people he could train birth the idea of
            this foundation and it is with this that we honour his memory
            and live in his legacy.
            <br>
